**Automate DNS â†” Docker â†” Caddy reverse proxy**  
**Created by: Revi9x**

## ðŸ”§ What it does  
- Fetches A-records from cPanel zone for your domain  
- Scans running Docker containers to discover host ports  
- Prioritises UDP ports (for game servers) â†’ TCP ports as fallback  
- Builds a Caddyfile with reverse_proxy entries for each subdomain  
- Removes stale entries automatically  
- Validates config, reloads Caddy safely and rolls back on failure  
- No external config files needed after the first run  
- Interactive setup for first use

## âœ… Requirements  
- `bash` (version 5 or higher)  
- `curl`  
- `jq`  
- `docker` (with `caddy` container running, named e.g. `revive-caddy`)
